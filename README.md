# School_District_Analysis

## Overview :
This study was conducted to review school's academic history as allegations were made for academic dishonesty. We had records of different schools and their academic records and once we replaced the math and reading scores, we repeated the school district analysis that we did in this module and wrote a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.

## Results of Analysis :

*After we replaced the data -
- District Summary: drop in both overall average math and reading scores, and overall pass rates (minimal)
- School Summary: drop in all metrics, but not enough to cause change in rankings
- School Type: drop in metrics, but matches pattern of Charter schools yielding higher pass rates and scores
- School Funding: drop in metrics, but Thomas High School still shows one of the best rates/scores for their respective funding group
- By Grade, and by School: the removed data had higher scores than the average school, but could reasonably fit in the dataset. Examining all the scores have shown   that math has higher variance from school to school, and the scores are very influenced by which school the student goes to
